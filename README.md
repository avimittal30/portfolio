## Generative AI Applications
* Finetuned google/flan-t5-base model using NVIDIA questions answer pair dataset shared on Kaggle to improve the accuracy of responses generated by the model.
The eval_loss of the finetuned model was significantly lower compared to that of original model with same model configurations.
* Created a Streamlit-based MCQ generator app using OPENAI's gpt-3.5-turbo that takes in text input and generates a set of MCQs along with correct answers in a structured format. The complexity of the quiz is evaluated and redesigned as per the cognitive ability of the students.
* Built Flask based naturopathy chatbot employing RAG architecture to recommend natural treatments for any medical issues. The model used was llama-2-7b model and vectordatabase was pinecone
